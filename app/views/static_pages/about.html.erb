  <p>What Am I Brewing? (Wamibrew) is a smart beer recipe generator for homebrewers.</p>
  <p>How it works...</p>
  <p>
    When you ask Wamibrew what to brew, it randomly generates a brew-able recipe and then attempts to heuristically
     determine what style of beer most closely matches the generated recipe based on calculated attributes.  Every recipe is guaranteed to make beer!...
     of some kind.

  <p>Calculations:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Bitterness: Wamibrew uses a modified version of Jackie Rager's method to calculate IBUs, adjusted to
        more closely match Glenn Tinseth's more recent method.  For a full discussion and source formulae see
        Norm Pyle's <a href="http://www.realbeer.com/hops/FAQ.html#units">excellent article</a> on the subject.
      </li>
      <li>
        Grains: Malt potential, yield, and SRM values are based manufacturer data when possible, e.g. <a href="http://www.briess.com/">Briess Malting</a>.
      </li>
      <li>
        Yeast: Wamibrew uses a standard Alcohol by Volume calculation based on an averaged yeast attenuation value by strain.
        Values from <a href="https://www.wyeastlab.com/">Wyeast</a> and <a href="http://www.whitelabs.com/">White Labs</a> respectively.
